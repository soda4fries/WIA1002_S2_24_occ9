In the intro file add this:

Project Selected (Topic No : Name)
Group Leader
Group Members List

Then Group Leaders modify the CODEOWNER File after you have been added as Collaborator to ensure other group cannot
accidentally modify your groups project

# This is a sample CODEOWNERS file

# Assigning code owners for specific files or directories
# Format: <pattern> <username>

# Assigning a user to a directory and all its contents recursively
src/ @username2

# Assigning multiple users to a file or directory
tests/ @username3 @username4

After that to Collaborate create a branch with GP-* syntax and collaborate with that. Then Merge once in a while to main
