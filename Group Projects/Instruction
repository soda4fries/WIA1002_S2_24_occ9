In the intro file add this:

Project Selected
Group Leader
Group Members List

Then Group Leaders modify the CODEOWNER File after you have been added as Collaborator to ensure other group cannot
accidentally modify your groups project

# This is a sample CODEOWNERS file

# Assigning code owners for specific files or directories
# Format: <pattern> <username>

# Assigning a user to a directory and all its contents recursively
src/ @username2

# Assigning multiple users to a file or directory
tests/ @username3 @username4

After that to Collaborate create a branch with GP-* syntax and collaborate with that. Then Merge once in a while to main
